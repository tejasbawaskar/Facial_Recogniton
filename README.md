# Facial_Recogniton

In this project we will be building an optimized model that will run through multiple 2d pics of famous celebreties and will give an output in very little time. First the number of features will be redcued, and transformed inorder to optimize the process. And eventually it will be fed in a model that will categorize/recognize and predict each picture accurately.
